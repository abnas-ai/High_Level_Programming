## Introduction

High level programming languages are designed to be easy for humans to read and write. They abstract away most of the complex details of the computer's hardware, allowing you to focus on solving problems and building applications.

## Languages Covered

This repository covers the following high level programming languages:

- Python
- JavaScript
- Ruby
- Java
- C#

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into directories for each programming language. Each directory contains subdirectories for different projects and exercises.

```
/home/abnazz/Desktop/My_projects/Africode_High_Level_Programming/
├── Python/
├── JavaScript/
├── Ruby/
├── Java/
└── C#/
```
